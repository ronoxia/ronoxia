# 👋 Hi, I’m @ronoxia

💡 I’m a neurodivergent data scientist in the making.  
🌱 Currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Science in Biomedicine at UCLA.  
🎓 Previously earned my B.S. in Computational & Systems Biology + Neuroscience (with Honors) — also from UCLA.  

🔬 I’m passionate about the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and health.

🤝 Looking to collaborate on research or projects related to:
- Brain-computer interfaces (BCI)
- Machine learning in healthcare
- Neuroscience 

📂 I'm actively building my portfolio with ML, data science, and reproducible research projects — especially those with social or scientific impact.

💌 Reach me at: [fancysmartypantx@gmail.com](mailto:fancysmartypantx@gmail.com)  
🌐 Personal site & learning journey coming soon!

😄 Pronouns: she/her or they/them  
🍜 Fun fact: I was a food entrepreneur before pivoting into tech. I ran a ghost kitchen dumpling business (4.3⭐ on Yelp!) — now I’m folding data instead of dumplings.
